like, then wrap the remaining unbaked biscuits tightly in plastic wrap and freeze for up to 1 month. unbaked biscuit dough should be stored in the freezer; storing in the refrigerator may cause the

remain. shake the bowl to coax any large chunks of butter to the surface. if you have warm hands or the process is taking too long, chill the bowl in the refrigerator for 20 minutes to cool down--you don't want the dough to be greasy at all! mix the egg yolks and ice water together in a small bowl with a fork until evenly combined. add the egg mixture to the dry ingredients, reserving  1/4 or so in case you don't need all of it--you don't want the pastry to be too wet. quickly mix everything together with a fork until the dough just starts to come together. add more liquid to the driest parts of the dough, if needed. the dough is ready when it holds together in a ball when squeezed in your palm. transfer the dough to a clean work surface and bring the dough together. you don't want to overwork the dough, but it should be a cohesive disc with no real cracks or very dry bits. divide the dough into 2 discs, 1 slightly larger and 1 slightly smaller. wrap the discs in plastic wrap and chill for at least 30 minutes, or up to 4 days. meanwhile, make the blueberry filling: in a medium bowl, mix together the blueberries, lemon juice,  2/3  cup of sugar, and the remaining 2 tablespoons of flour. preheat the grill on medium-high for about 10 minutes, to about 375@f (190@c). lightly flour a clean surface and unwrap the smaller disc of chilled dough. flour the top of the dough. using a rolling pin, roll out the dough, giving it a quarter turn every few times, to spread the dough evenly and ensure it doesn't stick to the surface. if any cracks form, smush them back together. roll out the dough to a circle about  1/4 inch thick and 8 inches (20 cm) wide. use the star-shaped cookie cutter to cut about 12 stars. roll out the larger disc of dough, creating a circle about 13 inches (32 cm) wide. pour the blueberries into the center of the larger circle and form into an even circle, leaving a 2-inch (5-cm) border all the way around. use your hand to fold the edges of the crust over the filling. place the stars over the blueberry filling, slightly overlapping. refrigerate the galette if not grilling immediately, up to 2 hours. before grilling, brush the beaten egg over the crust and stars and sprinkle the remaining tablespoon of sugar all over the galette. carefully transfer the galette to a 12-inch (30 cm) square piece of aluminum foil set over an inverted rimmed metal baking sheet. fold the edges of the foil up to catch any dripping juices. set the baking sheet at the center of the grill and close the lid. grill for 30 minutes, until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling. check every 10 minutes and adjust the heat level as needed. let cool for at least 30 minutes, then slice and serve with a dollop of whipped cream. enjoy!", "protein": "10.0",
